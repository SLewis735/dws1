      	<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      	<p>Smoking cessation (colloquially quitting smoking) is the process of discontinuing 
      	 tobacco smoking. Tobacco contains nicotine, which is addictive,[1] making the 
      	 process of quitting often very prolonged and difficult.</p><br />
      	<p>Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide, and quitting
      	 smoking significantly reduces the risk of dying from tobacco-related diseases
      	 such as heart disease and lung cancer.[2] Seventy percent of smokers would like 
      	 to quit smoking, and 50 percent report attempting to quit within the past year.[
      	 3] Many different strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including 
      	 quitting without assistance ("cold turkey" or cut down then quit), medications 
      	 such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline, and behavioral counseling. 
      	 The majority of smokers who try to quit do so without assistance, though only 
      	 3 to 6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful.[4] Use of medications
      	 and behavioral counseling both increase success rates, and a combination of both 
      	 medication and behavioral interventions has been shown to be even more effective.[5]
      	 </p><br />
         <p>Because nicotine is addictive, quitting smoking leads to symptoms of nicotine 
         withdrawal such as craving, anxiety and irritability, depression, and weight gain.[
         6]:2298 Professional smoking cessation support methods generally endeavor to address 
         both nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal symptoms.</p>

      <article>
      	<h3>Symptoms</h3>
      	<p>In a 2007 review of the effects of abstinence from tobacco, Hughes concluded that <q>
      	"anger, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, and restlessness 
      	are valid withdrawal symptoms that peak within the first week and last 2â€“4 weeks."</q>
      	[121] In contrast, <q>"constipation, cough, dizziness, increased dreaming, and mouth ulcers"</q> 
      	may or may not be symptoms of withdrawal, while drowsiness, fatigue, and certain physical symptoms
      	<q>("dry mouth, flu symptoms, headaches, heart racing, skin rash, sweating, tremor")</q> were not 
      	symptoms of withdrawal.</p>
      	<h3>Weight Gain</h3>
      	<h3>Depression</h3>
      	<h3>Anxiety</h3>

      <h2 id="about_us">About us</h2>
      	<p>I created "Don't be a Quitter!" as a capstone project in a project management course
      	that I took when I was studying for my Associate of Science in Graphic Communication 
      	and Design at ITT Tech. I designed the logo used on this website for that project. It was during a 
      	time when I had stopped smoking myself.</p>
