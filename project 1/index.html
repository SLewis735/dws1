  			<h2>History</h2>
				<p>Back in the 1890's, the Jenkins family had a history of hunting wild pigs and hogs and they would smoked them until the meat would fall from the bones. Pa Stab Jenkins and his sons would start at the crack of dawn, hunting and trapping hogs, deer and even wild game birds. They also raised their own cattle and chicken. Ma Jenkins would add her special secret sauces the to finished meat and people would come from miles around to grab their taste of the Jenkins down home finger licking goodness of pork, beef or venison. Thus, creating a family tradition of home cooked barbecue.</p>
